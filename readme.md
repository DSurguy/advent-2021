This is 2021's attempt to complete advent of code, let's see how far I get

### Running The Code
You can run a specific day using `npm run start:day #` where # is the day you want to run.

Example of running day 5: `npm run start:day 5` or `npm run start:day -- --day=5`

### Debugging
Instead of `start:day` run `debug:day` with all the same other arguments.
